# Project Filler CLI

## What is it ?

This project aims to help developers to fill most programming projects (JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, JAVA..) with tools and good practices proposed by Zenika. It is a command line interface that will detect your project's stack and will search for rules to apply corresponding to this stack.

## How can I use it ?

For the moment, the project is not really usable, but you can try it using the binary release corresponding to your platform. [Download the release tarball](https://github.com/DX-DeveloperExperience/project-starter/releases), decompress it, and run the bin/project-starter-cli binary in your shell like this :

`./bin/project-starter-cli /path/to/your/project`

If you are a developer and would like to contribute to the project, just clone or fork the repository, and to launch it without needing to make a tarball, just launch this command at the root of the project :

`bin/run /path/to/your/project`
